# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel moderately confident with the `for` statement syntax, but I feel that I need more information on why the "final expression" portion of the syntax is represented by `++` or `+=2`. The latter makes a bit more sense because it explicitly states what increment the increase is going by. I am not sure why `++` means the same thing as `+=1`, or if it even does! 

In fact, I will take a moment now to play around with the concept, but I would love to discuss it in some detail with my instructor or classmates.

1. This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I was very fortunate to have tried some self-paced courses for coding on Udemy for Python and Javascript before starting mod 0, even though I did not get past 5 or 10% through those courses before this week arrived. I recognized a good amount of the syntax from those courses, so I know I felt FAR less overwhelmed than some of my cohortmates today. 

I feel that I had productive struggle today with very little unproductive struggle, as I was able to look up most of the questions that I had (including the one from above).

I just read a bit on the difference between i++ and ++i, and I am going to practice the concepts with the for loops in this assignment so I can see the practical difference! 

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to practice using for loops with arrays more often, as I feel like that will be a combination that we use on a daily basis in many different areas of programming. Being able to cycle through a list and perform an action on each value in sequence seems like a mechanism that is in use very often within this field.

I would like to practice what happens if you have a array with multiple data types and you try to use it within a for loop. What operators work with both strings and numbers? I imagine that would be something very, very rarely used, but interesting nonetheless.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I don't currently have many more questions than stated above, but if I want to explore further I will go with the Mozilla Developer Network web docs or stackoverflow, though I am realizing that the MDN web docs page seems much more carefully moderated and updated compared to Stackoverflow, which has a lot of noise / static because of the way the answers are either voted up or down.
